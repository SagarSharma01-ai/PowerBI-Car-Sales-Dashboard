1.  **Double-Down on What Works:** Focus inventory and marketing heavily on our "Big 3" segments: **SUVs, Hatchbacks, and Sedans**.
2.  **Stock Smart (Colors):** Ensure top-selling models are always stocked in the most popular colors: **Pale White, Black, and Red**.
3.  **Replicate Success:** Launch an initiative to study the sales tactics, dealer performance, and local marketing of the **Austin** region to replicate its success elsewhere.
